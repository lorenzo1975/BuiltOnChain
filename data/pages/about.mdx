## Current Status

I'm currently seeking employment as a FullStack Developer. I'm open to remote positions.
If you would like to work together feel free to send me an email at [inezabonte@gmail.com](mailto:inezabonte@gmail.com)

## What I'm currently working on

- So far [Gatsby Summer Functions](https://queen.raae.codes/) has been going great. In the first
  few weeks I was able to learn about Gatsby and the new Serverless functions. We are currently on a
  week break as we work on the third challenge which is about limiting usage of your function with Auth0
- I also have a new project I'm working on ü•≥. A Digital Garden üå≥. It's still in its early phase, I'll be
  sure to share it when I'm done with most of the work.

## Anything else?

Be kind to one another. ‚ù§Ô∏è
